##To-Do APP

This is a really simple app which allows you to add and, delete and view your todo list. The view function can be utilized by the console. To add a new todo, simply enter 'new' and click enter. You will then be prompted to write your todo e.g Walk the dog. To delete, enter 'delete' and click enter. You must enter the exact index (starting at 0) of the todo you wish to delete. To view your whole list, type 'list' and you should see the list in the console. You may quit the app by typing 'quit' when prompted what you would like to do.
